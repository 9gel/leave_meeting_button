# Leave Meeting Button

<img src="./images/switch.jpg?raw=true" width="400" height="400"/>

Files for building your own Single-button "keyboard" that does only one thing - leave any Zoom meetings.

See demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GqqAG8KL6Q

## What it is

* A single-switch mechanical keyboard / macropad with a large 3D-printed keycap
* Supported by 3 stabilizers so you can press anywhere
* Powered by a Pro Micro
* A prototype - not for sale (yet)

## How to build (TL;DR)

* Procure:
  * A standard Cherry switch
  * One 6.25x plate-mounted stabilizer
  * Two 2x plate-mounted stabilizer
  * A Sparkfun Pro Micro, clone, or a microcontroller of your choosing
  * A 10K resistor - 1/4 W worked for me
  * Two M3x10 countersunk screws
  * Two M3 nuts
* Print the 3 STL files
* Wire up the switch and program
  * Flash the Pro Micro - included `leavemeeting` file is an example
  * Wire up the Pro Micro
* Assemble the thing like the above image

## Outstanding items

* Use a cheaper microcontroller - some suggested digispark / Attiny85
* RGB lighting effects?

TODO - circuit diagram, etc.
